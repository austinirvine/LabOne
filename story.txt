A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
An eleven warrior known as lord fantasy
pulled out his sword from beneath his other sword,
but weirdly enough the sword was actually the pencil
used to write this story.  It was one of those 
gimmicky things people buy at conveince stores in
Las Vegas or New York City.  Society is materialistic.

So, it is my belief the malignance of society will eventually
lead to the great exodus.  You know, the rupturing of volcanos,
the sky is falling, baby's giving birth to their own mom's, and
deadly diseases with diabetes.  It's a strange thought and 
an even stranger Universe.
