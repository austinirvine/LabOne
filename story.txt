A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.
An eleven warrior known as lord fantasy
pulled out his sword from beneath his other sword,
but weirdly enough the sword was actually the pencil
used to write this story.  It was one of those 
gimmicky things people buy at conveince stores in
Las Vegas or New York City.  Society is materialistic.
